CVE-2024-38100 Remote Code Execution Proof of Concept

README.md - The readme will repeat all the following information about the vulnerability so you don't forget it

automate.py - Automates the LeakedWallpaper\main.cpp and CVE-2024-38100.py so you can check targets for vulnerabilities then exploit those vulnerabilities without having to do it all by hand individually

check_targets.py - As the name says, it checks targets. You pull a list of targets from Shodan or Zoom eye, throw the IPs into a text file, and then scan them to check if they're vulnerable or not. Alterantively you could run massscans and just check for the ports for an internet exposed vulnerabilities.

CVE-2024-38100.py - The PoC is in fully working condition, makes use of the LeakedWallpaper exploit within Linux. You can see more of how it works back on our github page or in the README.md file

LeakedWallpaper.sln - The exploited wallpaper file.

LeakedWallpaper\main.cpp - The actual exploit used by the python exploit files so you can customize it if you need.
